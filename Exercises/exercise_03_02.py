# Greetings: start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1,
# but instead of just printing each person's name, print
# a message to them. The text of each message should be
# the same, but each message should be personalized with
# the person's name

names = ['alan', 'dennis', 'ken', 'ada', 'brian'];

print("Hello, " + names[0].title() + ". It is nice to meet you!")
print("Hello, " + names[1].title() + ". It is nice to meet you!")
print("Hello, " + names[2].title() + ". It is nice to meet you!")
print("Hello, " + names[3].title() + ". It is nice to meet you!")
print("Hello, " + names[4].title() + ". It is nice to meet you!")

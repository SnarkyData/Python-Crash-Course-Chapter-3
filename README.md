# Python Crash Course - Chapter 3 Exercises and Solutions

This repository contains the Example, Exercises, and Solutions
for Chapter 3 of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.

I created this repository for two reasons. First, I wanted to
incorporate Git and GitHub into my workflow, so I could give
myself an opportunity to practice the technologies. Second, I
wanted to show my work. That is, I used C and Vim on a Fedora
37 system in a VirtualBox environment to create, use, and 
manage directories and files as I work through Matthes' Python
Crash Course book.

Please feel free to reach out to me at matthewjohnson@snarkydata.com
if you have any questions or comments. In addition, feel free to
utilize the solutions for your consumption and edification.

Technical Notes and Considerations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and execute the Chapter 3 files,

    (1) copy the code and paste it directly into your preferred
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE), PyCharm, Sublime,
        or Visual Studio Code, for example, or your preferred text
        editor, Vim, Nano, and Emacs, for example,
    (2) and either build and run the files in your IDE
    (3) or use the following command-line script:

            $ python3 name_of_file.py
